    <p>This document describes the DOME Onboarding process and its associated Digital Identity Management system, used to interact with DOME services.
    </p>

<section id='Overview of Onboarding and Service Certification'><h2>Overview of Onboarding and Service Certification</h2>

    <p>Before your company can publish Product Offerings in the DOME Marketplace, the following steps have to be performed:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Onboarding of the company</b> in the DOME Marketplace, requiring:
<ul>
            <div>
            <li><b>Identification and verification of the legal representative</b> and the right of representation.
                <div>
                <p>The employee performing the onboarding process has to be able to demonstrate to the DOME Operator that it has the powers required to act on behalf of your company for the process of onboarding in DOME. The employee can be a legal representative or an employee "nominated" by a legal representative for the specific purpose of performing the process of onboarding in DOME.
                </p>
                </div>
            </li>
            </div>
            <div>
            <li><b>Identification of legal person (the company)</b> on the basis of documents and data submitted, and verification of the submitted information on the basis of information obtained from a reliable and independent source.
                <div>
                <p>You have to demonstrate that your company is incorporated and that is has basic legal capacity to act in the EU internal market.
                </p>
                </div>
            </li>
            </div>
</ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Certification of each Product Offering</b>, required to be able to publish a product offering in the marketplace. It is done for each product offering.
            <div>
            <p>For each product offering that you want to publish in the DOME Marketplace, your company has to demonstrate that the product complies with the requirements setup by DOME (as per the requirements from the European Commission and Member States).
            </p>
            </div>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>We describe in this document both processes, because they are very interrelated: you have to prove some facts about your company and its product offereings before they are published in the DOME Marketplace. The mechanisms for those proofs are very similar.
    </p>
    <section id='Onboarding of your company in DOME'><h2>Onboarding of your company in DOME</h2>

        <p>If your company is already using eIDAS certificates (e.g., for digitally signing PDFs, invoices or other types of documents), then the process can be performed digitally. Using advanced or qualified signatures facilitates a fully digital and automated cross-border onboarding process, and at the same time provides a reasonable balance between automation, convenience, and level of legal certainty and security.
        </p>
        <p>However, there are still countries in the EU which are lagging in the widespread use of eIDAS signatures. This is expected to change soon, given the push provided by the introduction of eIDAS2 and thanks to a timely implementation of the European Digital Identity Wallet by the Member States (they will be obliged to issue Digital Identity Wallets within 12 months of the entry into force of the Regulation).
        </p>
        <p>This is the reason why, in the mean time, we provide two mechanisms for onboarding in DOME:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>A <b>digital and automated cross-border onboarding</b> process based on signatures under the current eIDAS legal framework and aligned at the same time with eIDAS2, which provides a reasonable balance between automation, convenience, and level of legal certainty and security. This is the preferred mechanism.
            </li>
            <li>A <b>“classical” manual process</b>, which is more <b>cumbersome, lengthy, and inconvenient</b> than the digital one, but is available as an exceptional temporary measure to those companies not yet at the required level of digitalisation in the eIDAS framework and which are not capable of using eIDAS digital signatures.

    <p>The digital onboarding process is the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>A legal representative of your company authorises an employee to perform the process of onboarding. This is done by issuing a LEARCredential to the employee.
        </li>
        <li>The authorised employee starts the onboarding process in the DOME onboarding portal, authenticating with the LEARCredential. The employee completes the forms presented by the DOME portal, and the onboarding process is completed.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Both steps are described below.

            <p>The site is intended for Legal Representatives of companies who want to issue one or more LEARCredentials to one or more employees of the company. A LEARCredential is a type of Verifiable Credential which enables an employee, nominated by a legal representative, to act on behalf of an organisation with restricted powers with respect to third-parties.
            </p>
            <p>The issuer (the creator) of the LEARCredential must be a legal representative of the company. The legal representative will sign the LEARCredential with an eIDAS digital certificate, which can be either a personal one or a certificate of representation.
            </p>
            <p>The receiver of the LEARCredential (both the subject and holder of the credential) can be any employee (or contractor) of the company. The legal representative will delegate a restricted set of powers to that person. Those restricted powers are included inside the credential and can be verified by any Relying party to whom the holder presents the LEARCredential.
            </p>
            <p>If you are a legal representative of the company and you have an eIDAS certificate installed in your PC, click on the yellow button to start the process:

            <p>The form has the following sections:
            </p>
            <section id='Mandator'><h2>Mandator</h2>

                <p>The Mandator is the person delegating a restricted set of powers onto an employee (the Mandatee). This part of the form is pre-filled with information coming from the eIDAS certificate that was used to enter into the application, plus the email address that was registered and verified.
                </p>
                <p>You do not have to enter anything else in this section.

            </section>
            <section id='Mandatee'><h2>Mandatee</h2>

                <p>The Mandatee is the employee (or subcontractor) who receives a restricted set of powers to act on behalf of the company with third-parties. In our case, the employee will be empowered to perform the Onboarding process in DOME, and maybe to create Product Offerings in the Marketplace.
                </p>
               <p>You have to fill the data corresponding to the employee that you want to nominate to perform the Onboarding process. After creating the LEARCredential, the employee will receive a notification in the email address that you entered in the form.

            </section>
            <section id='Powers'><h2>Powers</h2>

                <p>These are the specific powers that the Mandator (you) is delegating on the Mandatee (the employee).
                </p>
                <p>The LEARCredential is a general purpose electronic Mandate, but in our case we need only two powers:
                </p>
                <li>Execute the Onboarding process in DOME
                </li>
                <li>Create/Update/Delete one or more Product Offerings in the DOME Marketplace
                </li>
                <figure><img class='figureshadow' src='images/dome_issuer/powers.png' alt='Powers'>
                <figcaption>Powers</figcaption></figure>

                <p>You can assign each power to a different employee (with one LEARCredential for each employee), or both powers to the same employee (with one LEARCredential including both powers). You can even generate more than one LEARCredential with the same or different powers to one or more employees. This is up to you and how you want to distribute the powers among your employees.
                </p>
                <p>The Mandate in the form of a Verifiable Credential behaves like its paper counterpart with regards to these properties.
                </p>
                <p>For Onboarding, make sure that the employee receives at least the Onboarding power:

            <p>Press the "Create" button at the bottom of the form. This will take you to a screen with the machine-readable representation of the new LEARCredential. Do not worry, you do not have to understand this, but if you do (or somebody in your company) it is a good way to see the actual contents that will go inside the LEARCredential, before sending it to the employee.

        <section id='List of created LEARCredentials'><h2>List of created LEARCredentials</h2>

            <p>You are taken back to the list of LEARCredentials that you have created. If this is the first time that you have created a credential, thee screen looks like the following.
            </p>

            <p>The button "View" at the left of every item allows you to review the credential, and also to send a reminder email to the target employee, in case the employee has not yet retrieved the credential.
            </p>
            <p>LEARCredentials have three states:
            </p>
            <li><b>offered</b>: A draft version of the credential has been created with all required information about Mandator, Mandatee and the Powers of Representation. A notification via email has been sent to the employee who will receive the powers. The name <code>offered</code> denotes that the employee has to accept the credential and load it to the Wallet of th eemployee.
            </li>
            <li><b>tobesigned</b>: The employee has accepted the LEARCredential, after reviewing the information contained in it. This step is necessary because the LEARCredential contains cryptographic material which will allow the employee to authenticate to DOME, and that cryptographic material can only be generated by the Wallet of the employee, to ensure the solo control of the private key.
            </li>
            <li><b>signed</b>: After the employee accepts the credential, you have to sign it with your eIDAS certificate. After your signature, the credential is signed and ready to be loaded by the employee in her Wallet and use it.
            </li>
</ul>
        </section>
        <section id='The employee receives a notification for the LEARCredential'><h2>The employee receives a notification for the LEARCredential</h2>

            <p>The employee receives an email notification like the one below.
            </p>
            <figure><img class='figureshadow' src='images/dome_issuer/employee_offer_notification.png' alt='Employee email notification initial'>
            <figcaption>Employee email notification initial</figcaption></figure>

            <p>When clicking on the button, the employee is directed to the DOME Issuer portal to review and (possibly) confirm the LEARCredential.
            </p>
            <p>The screen that the employee sees is similar to the one below.
            </p>
            <figure><img class='figureshadow' src='images/dome_issuer/employee_credential_accept_portal.png' alt='Employee Issuer portal initial'>
            <figcaption>Employee Issuer portal initial</figcaption></figure>

            <p>The employee has several possibilities for receiving and using the LEARCredential. The employee can use any Wallet which is compatible with the current EDIW implementation.
            </p>
            <p>However, while the market matures, DOME offers a reference implementation of a Wallet which is the one we will use for the description of the onboarding process.
            </p>
            <p>The DOME Wallet is a web application that can be used in several types of devices: mobile, tablet, PC. It supports iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Linux and other environments where a standards-compliant implementation of an Internet browser is available (like ChromeOS).
            </p>
            <p>The functionalities of the DOME Wallet are not as comprehensive as in native implementations, but they are enough to support the requirements of the DOME Marketplace.
            </p>
            <p>For this tutorial, we will use the DOME Wallet and for simplicity we will assume the employee uses the Wallet in the same device that was used to present the previous screen.
            </p>
            <p>In order to proceed, the employee clicks on the following link (even if the device is not a mobile):
            </p>
            <figure><img class='figureshadow' src='images/dome_issuer/employee_credential_accept_portal_link.png' alt='Employee Issuer portal link'>

        </section>
        <section id='The employee reviews and confirms the LEARCredential'><h2>The employee reviews and confirms the LEARCredential</h2>

            <p>When clicking the above link, a new Wallet is automatically provisioned for the employee in the device that the employee is using, and the Wallet presents the draft version of the LEARCredential to the user.
            </p>
            <p>The employee sees a screen that looks like the following.
            </p>
            <figure style='width:50%'><img class='figureshadow' src='images/dome_issuer/wallet_review_offered_credential.png' alt='Wallet review offer'>
            <figcaption>Wallet review offer</figcaption></figure>

            <p>The Wallet displays a preview of the LEARCredential. The credential is marked with a red warning stating that the credential is not yet valid because it is missing the signature from the legal representative. This signature will be performed later.
            </p>
            <p>The employee has to accept the credential by clicking the button "Save credential". Once this is done, the credential changes to the status <code>tobesigned</code> and is ready to be signed by the legal representative.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id='The legal representative signs the LEARCredential'><h2>The legal representative signs the LEARCredential</h2>

            <p>The legal representative has to use the eIDAS certificate to sign the LEARCredential and there are different ways to perform this signature. We describe here the most common scenario, where the legal representative has installed the certificate in her PC. This is the typical way to sign PDFs (e.g., with Acrobat Reader), and in the same way, the legal representative has to use a program in her PC to sign the LEARCredential.
            </p>
            <p>DOME provides such a program, called "elsignerw". Installation is very simple and involves simply to download the binary and running it whenever is needed.

<section id='Manual onboarding process'><h2>Manual onboarding process</h2>

    <p>As in the digital case, we also require that the natural person driving the onboarding process should be either a legal representative of the participant or a natural person that has been delegated by a legal representative at least the powers required to perform the onboarding process on behalf of the legal entity.
    </p>
    <p>Without digital signatures, the process is the following:

<section id='The LEARCredential as Powers of Representation' class='appendix'><h2>The LEARCredential as Powers of Representation</h2>

    <p>The LEARCredential is a machine-readable document representing a Mandate or Powers of Representation. The format used in DOME is a Verifiable Credential using an eIDAS signature to bind the mandate data with the real-world identity of the issuer of the credential.
    </p>
    <p>We base our design in the [[RPaM-Ontology]], which is a project started in 2018 by the Directorate-General for Informatics (DG-DIGIT) of the European Commission, funded by the ISA Programme, to organise and support the development of an ontology about the Representation of Powers and Mandates, from now on the <b>RPaM Ontology</b>.
    </p>
    <p>We adapt the results of that project, with simplifications and specialisations, to the concrete environment where we use the LEARCredential. To facilitate the job of the reader of this document, in some sections we copy literal sentences from the RPaM Ontology project, and adapt the texts to our requirements. However, the reader is encouraged to access the original documents for more details and understand the original approach, including the <a href="https://everis-rpam.github.io/Glossary.html">RPaM Ontology Glossary</a>.
    </p>
    <section id='The Mandate'><h2>The Mandate</h2>

        <p>According to the RPaM Glossary, a "<i>mandate is a record that describes the terms under which a mandator grants a representation power to a mandatee</i>".
        </p>
        <p>The conceptual model for a <code>mandate</code> in DOME is represented below:
        </p>
        <div class='xcard'>
            <header><b>mandate</b>
            </header>
            <p>The <code>mandate</code> is composed of three related objects described below: <code>mandator</code>, <code>mandatee</code> and <code>power</code>. The <code>mandate</code> object is signed with an advanced or qualified signature using an eIDAS certificate.
            </p>
            <div class='xcard'>
                <header><b>mandator</b>
                </header>
                <p>The object <code>mandator</code> identifies the employee of the company who is delegating a subset of her powers on the <code>mandatee</code>.
                </p>
                <p>The <code>mandator</code> is either:
<ul>
                    <li>a legal representative of the company, according to the official records associated to the incorporation of the organisation (e.g., the business registry of the country of incorporation); or
                    </li>
                    <li>an employee who is a <code>mandatee</code> in another <code>mandate</code> where the <code>mandator</code> is a legal representative of the company. We do not support more than two levels of delegation.
                    </li>
</ul>
                </p>
                <p>In DOME, the Onboarding process requires that the <code>mandator</code> is the legal representative of the company, to ensure an appropriate level of legal certainty.
Other processes (after onboarding is completed), like creating a ProductOffering, can use any of the above options for the <code>mandator</code>, subject to the limitation of a maximum of two levels of delegation.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class='xcard'>
                <header><b>mandatee</b>
                </header>
                <p>The <code>mandatee</code> is the person granted with the power to represent (and act as) the company in some specific actions with third-parties. The powers granted to the <code>mandatee</code> must be a subset of the powers of the <code>mandator</code>. For example, an employee (the <code>mandatee</code>) can be empowered by the legal representative of the company (the <code>mandator</code>) to perform the onboarding process in DOME.
                </p>
                <p>The object <code>mandatee</code> identifies the employee on whom a subset of powers is delegated. The <code>mandatee</code> object contains:
<ul>
                    <li>A set of attributes of the employee which are required by the specific use case where the LEAR Credential will be used, for example to onboard in the DOME ecosystem and for creating a ProductOffering in the marketplace. Those attributes can be considered equivalent to the fields that would be filled in a form when a "classical" PDF document would be used to authorise an employee.
                    </li>
                    <li>A public key associated to the employee and where the employee is the sole controller of the associated private key. This is required to enable the use of the LEARCredential containing the <code>mandate</code> as an efficient, scalable and secure authentication and authorisation mechanism.
                    </li>
</ul>
                </p>
                <p>The private key controlled by the employee is used to prove to Relying parties receiving the LEARCredential that the holder and presenter of the credential is the same person identified in the <code>mandatee</code> object.
We support two mechanisms for the public key in the <code>mandatee</code> object:
<ul>
                    <li>Using a <code>did:key</code> where the employee controls the private key associated to the <code>did:key</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Using an eIDAS certificate owned by the employee.
                    </li>
</ul>
                </p>
                <p>The details of how the public key is bound to the identity of the <code>mandatee</code> can be found later in this document.

            <div class='xcard'>

                </header>
                <p>This object is a list of each specific power that is delegated from the <code>mandator</code> to the <code>mandatee</code>. The powers must be concrete and as constrained as possible, and must follow a taxonomy with the semantics well specified.
                </p>
                <p>In DOME, we have specified a power taxonomy targeted at the interactions with the DOME Federated Marketplace, supporting not only the onboarding process but also any other interaction after onboarding. The system uses the taxonomy to perform authentication and access control based on the LEARCredential presented by users. This means that the actions are well defined, homogeneous and standardised for the ecosystem. We are basically replacing the current mechanisms for Mandates (e.g., paper or PDF) with a more efficient, machine-processable representation in the form of a Verifiable Credential.
                </p>
                <p>Our Power Taxonomy could be generalised to other actions involving private sector companies, but it is out of scope of this version of the document.

    <section id='Mapping to a Verifiable Credential'><h2>Mapping to a Verifiable Credential</h2>

        <p>We now describe the mapping of the conceptual model into the concrete representation of a Mandate in a LEAR Credential, and more specifically to the <code>jwt_vc_json</code> representation (VC Signed as a JWT, Not Using JSON-LD), which is the one currently used in DOME.
        </p>
        <p>The <code>mandate</code> is represented in the LEAR Credential as an object inside the <code>credentialSubject</code> object. An example of a complete LEARCredential is the following:

        <section id='Mandate'><h2>Mandate</h2>

            <p>In the above example, we have specified that the <code>mandator</code> (the legal representative of the company) has delegated to the <code>mandatee</code> (the employee who will be the owner of the LEAR Credential) one single power to access services in the DOME ecosystem (specified with the fields <code>tmf_type</code> and <code>tmf_name</code>) with the specific capability to perform the onboarding of the company in the DOME ecosystem (specified with the fields <code>tmf_function</code> and <code>tmf_action</code>). The actual data model, which can be used to express mor complex delegations is described below in more detail.
            </p>
            <p>The <code>mandate</code> has an optional <code>id</code> field which can be used to identify the Mandate when the Verifiable Credential is used to represent a Mandate which exists in other systems like a <a href="https://sede.administracion.gob.es/PAG_Sede/ServiciosElectronicos/RegistroElectronicoDeApoderamientos.html">centralised eMandate registry</a>. When the Mandate is created with the Verifiable Credential, the <code>id</code> field of the <code>mandate</code> object can be ommitted and the <code>id</code> of the credential can be used to identify the Mandate, and revoke it if needed. To maintain privacy, the <code>id</code> field should not have any relationship with the rest of the data in the Mandate.
            </p>
            <p>Similarly, the <code>mandate</code> has the optional fields <code>validFrom</code> and <code>validTo</code> which can be used when the credential represents a Mandate that exists externally. The typical use case is when the Mandate in the external system has a big life span and the issuer of the LEARCredential wants the credential to have a smaller life span. In any case, a Relying party receiving the LEARCredential should use the more restrictive life span when performing the verification checks. That is, it must use the biggest of the <code>validFrom</code> claims, and the smallest of the <code>validTo</code> claims.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id='Mandator500'><h2>Mandator</h2>

            <p>There are two possible cases for the Mandator:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The Mandator is the legal representative of the company. In this case, the claims in the <code>mandator</code> object are a subset of the fields in the <code>subject</code> object in the eIDAS certificate that the legal representative uses to sign the LEARCredential. The minimum set of fields are the ones in the example.
                </li>
                <li>The Mandator is an employee who is the Mandatee in another LEARCredential. In this case, the data in the <code>mandator</code> object must be the same data that appears in the <code>mandatee</code> object of the related LEARCredential.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>In this second case, the <code>powerSource</code> in the <code>power</code> object (see later) must be the LEARCredential which was used to delegate the powers to the <code>mandator</code> from the legal representative of the company.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id='Mandatee511'><h2>Mandatee</h2>

            <p>The <code>mandatee</code> object contains a set of attributes of the employee which are required by the specific use case where the LEAR Credential will be used, for example to onboard in the DOME ecosystem and for creating a ProductOffering in the marketplace.
            </p>
            <p>In DOME, the minimum attributes are <code>title</code>, <code>first_name</code>, <code>last_name</code>, <code>email</code> and <code>mobile_phone</code>.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, the <code>mandatee</code> object contains a public key where the employee is the sole controller of the associated private key. There are two possible cases:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>The employee wants to use her <code>did:key</code> where the employee controls the private key associated to the <code>did:key</code>. In this case, the <code>id</code> claim of the <code>mandatee</code> object is the <code>did:key</code>.
                </li>
                <li>The employee wants to use her personal or professional eIDAS certificate. In this case, the <code>mandatee</code> object must include two claims: the <code>id</code> claim with the <code>did:key</code> corresponding to the public key in the eIDAS certificate, and the claim <code>x5c</code> with the certificate itsef (which also incudes the public key, but we require the <code>id</code> field for completeness).
                </li>
            </ol>
        </section>
        <section id='Power'><h2>Power</h2>

            <p>This object is an array where each element is a power that is delegated from the Mandator to the Mandatee. The fields of each power object are:
<ul>
                <li><code>id</code>: The identifier of the power, which must be unique in the context of the Credential where it is included. It can be used as a reference when performing access control, for example in the audit records to identify the specific power that was used to grant access to some protected resource.
                </li>
                <li><code>powerSource</code> (conditional): The Mandator draws the power from one (or more) sources of power, e.g. 1) a concrete Legislation; 2) a piece of evidence (as another Mandate, in which case the mandator was a mandatee in that other mandate) and/or 3) a Natural Person with a specific profession that invest him/her with the authority to order to a mandator with a specific role the creation of a mandate, e.g. a judge authorising a civil servant (a <code>Mandator</code> that is a Natural Person with the appropriate role) to create a mandate for a relative to represent an incapacitated person).
                    <div>
                    <p>In DOME, there are three cases with specific sources of power:
                    </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                    <ol>
                        <li>When the Mandator is a legal representative of the company, and the LEARCredential is signed with the eIDAS certificate of representation of the legal representative. In this case, the <code>powerSource</code> claim can be ommitted as it is implicit in the eIDAS signature. Alternatively, the <code>powerSource</code> claim is an object with the following fields:
<ul>
                            <div>
                            <li><code>type</code>, with value "eulaw".

</ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>When the Mandator is a natural person who is the Mandatee in another LEARCredential. The <code>powerSource</code> claim is an object with the following fields:

                        <li>When the Mandator is a legal representative of the company, but does not have an eIDAS certificate of representation, the Mandator can not sign the LEARCredential. In this case, there must be a trusted third-party which attests that the Mandator is effectively a legal representative of the company. This trusted third-party must perform the required due diligence to confirm the relationship, and then sign the credential with its eIDAS certificate.
                            <div>
                            <p>In DOME, one of the trusted third-parties (trusted by DOME) is the DOME Operator itself, where the employees dedicated to the onboarding of participants perform the manual checks on the documentation provided by the Mandator/Mandatee, and then create and sign the LEARCredential.
                            </p>
                            </div>

The classification of services is arbitrary and defined by the service providers. A typical scenario is when some service providers agree on a classification of the services that they provide in the context of an ecosystem (like DOME), and the possible domains are made public, including the mapping to a given set of services in each provider.
